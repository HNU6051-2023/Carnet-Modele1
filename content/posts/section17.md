The mode of client participation in jurisdictional contestation we call ‘stewardship’ is enacted when a client experiences exclusively the emotional resonance of a profession’s defensive framing efforts. By stewardship, we mean clients seeking to actively reinforce the profession’s established arrangements. We argue that clients enact stewardship when they feel very afraid of relying on the movement’s alternative project and also somewhat ashamed of deviating from the profession’s prescriptions, angry at the movement for jeopardizing a proper response to their needs, and proud of supporting established arrangements. Clients experiencing this configuration of emotional resonance consider the profession’s expert knowledge to be highly trustworthy and remain fully attached to the profession as a collective actor. This configuration of emotional resonance is illustrated in Figure 6.

Exemplifying stewardship are those psychiatric patients who, in response to disruptive efforts like those of {{< cite "Chamberlin-1977" >}} (see ‘Escape’ above), advocate for _reinforcing_ the legal authority of psychiatrists to hospitalize and administer treatments to nonconsenting patients. When interviewed, a well-known mental health advocate who identifies as ‘schizophrenic’ argued that _greater_ coercive authority for psychiatrists would allow them to protect more effectively not only psychotic people but also citizens more generally when these people behave dangerously {{< cite "Vigneault-2016" >}}. This advocate’s position conveys a strong fear felt at the prospect of relying on the alternative project promoted by the psychiatric survivors’ movement, as well as mistrust of their experiential knowledge. It also suggests feelings of shame at the idea of deviating from the profession’s prescriptions and pride in supporting established arrangements, as well as anger towards disruptors of the psychiatric profession’s jurisdictional control over its work domain. This advocate’s stewardship of the psychiatric profession’s jurisdictional control represents an opposite reaction to the project laid out in {{< cite "Chamberlin-1977" >}}'s manifesto cited earlier and followed by clients who enact the escape mode.

Different, but also representative of the stewardship mode of participation, are celebrities representing the Bell Let’s Talk campaign across Canada, who testify to the sense of safety gained from accepting their mental disorder and seeking appropriate professional treatment to help them cope with it {{< cite "Rubin-2017" >}}. These high-profile clients of psychiatry are displaying their trust in the profession’s expert knowledge {{< cite "Dhami-2020" >}}. Their personal narratives in strong support of psychiatry’s jurisdictional control and the safety it provides simultaneously convey strong fear felt at the idea of relying on an alternative project of mutual aid among peers {{< cite "Vido-2019" >}}. In addition to the pride these celebrities take in publicly supporting established arrangements, their campaign may also reflect some shame at the idea of deviating from the profession’s prescriptions and anger at movements that disrupt what they see as the psychiatry’s proper response to the needs of clients. This configuration of emotional resonance reinforces their trust, as clients, in the profession’s expert knowledge and strengthens their attachment to the profession as collective actor.
