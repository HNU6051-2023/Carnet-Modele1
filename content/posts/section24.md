In this paper, we break new conceptual ground by theorizing how emotions shape the participation of professions’ clients in episodes of jurisdictional contestation. By offering an integrated and multi-level understanding of these processes, our model informs not only research but also the practice of both professionals and clients seeking to improve services by leveraging clients’ experiential knowledge to alter professionals’ work. In short, we hope that our paper makes a forceful case for engaging clients rather than dismissing them, in both theory and practice.
