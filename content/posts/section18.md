In this article, we have developed a model of how emotions shape the participation of professionsâ€™ clients in episodes of jurisdictional contestation. Our theorizing contributes to the literature on professions by conceptualizing client participation in jurisdictional contestation across analytical levels; considering the role of a constellation of four intertwined social emotions in this process; and introducing a typology of five modes of client participation in jurisdictional contestation. We developed our model by drawing on empirical examples from health-related professions and, in this section, we also discuss its generalizability to work domains other than health-related ones and to other stakeholders.
