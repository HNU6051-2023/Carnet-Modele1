{{< cite "Fligstein-2015" >}} conflict-oriented theory of fields emphasizes the power imbalance between marginalized challengers who seek to disrupt the institutional status quo and dominant incumbents who seek to defend it. It suggests that the emphasis on particular emotions evoked in the framing efforts of these collective actors may differ depending on their pursuit of a project of change or continuity, respectively. Empirical studies tend to corroborate this view, indicating that disruptive framing efforts of a challenger tend to emphasize pride of supporting its alternative institutional project and anger at the incumbent for breaching its duty [cf. {{< cite "Gamson-1992;Gould-2009" >}}, while defensive framing efforts of an incumbent tend to emphasize shame of deviating from its prescriptions and fear of relying on the challenger’s alternative project [cf. {{< cite "Gill-2018;Douglas_creed-2014" >}}. These different emphases may, in turn, affect how the framing efforts of challengers and incumbents resonate in the emotional experience of clients exposed to them. We unpack these insights in the next two sections.
