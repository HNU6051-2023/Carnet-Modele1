A jurisdiction “is the link between a profession and its work” [@abbott_system_1988, p20]. A profession controls a jurisdiction when it holds exclusive rights to interpret and respond to the needs of its clients in a given work domain [@scott_lords_2008; @hughes_men_1958]. Abundant research has focused on inter-profession competition for control over work domains [@langley_boundary_2019]. But collective actors other than rival professions can also challenge a profession’s jurisdictional control and engage in struggles over the boundaries and content of professionals’ work. Most research on these struggles, termed jurisdictional contestation, focuses on regulators of professions or managers of organizations in which professionals work [e.g., @currie_impact_2006; @kellogg_operating_2009]. Indeed, the negotiated nature of the regulatory bargain between states and professions to define legal boundaries around the work over which a profession’s members are granted jurisdictional control has long been at the core of sociological research on professions [@abbott_system_1988; @suddaby_transnational_2007].

In addition to regulators, organizational studies of professions have focused extensively on managers as key contestants of professionals’ jurisdictional control [e.g., @courpasson_managerial_2000; @kirkpatrick_new_2005]. This research has theorized how reform attempts by regulators and managers typically encounter resistance from profession [@currie_institutional_2012] and documented strategies used by each side to achieve settlements in their favour [e.g., @ackroyd_organization_1996; @courpasson_managerial_2000]. Stated motivations for reform attempts vary widely, including to improve interprofessional collaboration [@bucher_contestation_2016]; redistribute tasks to lower-status occupations[@reay_legitimizing_2006]; and improve service to clients [@kellogg_operating_2009]. But at the core of each of attempt is a desired change to established professional practices [@kellogg_operating_2009]. A key theme in much of this work is knowledge―its nature and relevance to professionals’ work as well as who possesses it. Outcomes of struggles over knowledge can profoundly alter a profession’s work domain. For example, @waring_managing_2009 studied how medical professionals reacted to UK hospital managers’ efforts to implement knowledge management techniques to enhance organizational learning around patient safety, which threatened physicians’ professional autonomy. They found that physicians adopted a range of responses that preserved their autonomy but altered the content of their work―and the requisite knowledge to do it―in ways that blurred the boundaries between professional and managerial ways of organizing work.

A profession uses _expert knowledge_—a system of abstractions guiding practical techniques and presumed to be exclusively held by the profession’s credentialed member [@freidson_professional_1986]—to legitimize its jurisdictional control over a work domain. Research on

professions has highlighted that, to maintain jurisdictional control, a profession must convince different audiences—including government regulators who oversee the profession’s activities, managers of organizations in professionals work, and the profession’s clients—that its expert knowledge can be trusted to inform problem diagnosis, solution prescription, and services rendered in ways that address clients’ needs [@muzio_professional_2020; @eyal_crisis_2019]. Thus, a profession and its clients are interdependent. Clients depend on the profession to address their needs, while the profession depends on clients’ trust in its expert knowledge to maintain jurisdictional control over its work domain [@huising_hive_2015; @lewis_trust_1985].

Despite the centrality of clients to professionals’ work, their role in jurisdictional contestation has remained remarkably overlooked [@anteby_three_2016, p211]. This gap represents an important matter of concern for organizational theorists in light of the ongoing “crisis of expertise” [@eyal_crisis_2019], which involves in many instances a rejection of professionals’ work by clients [@epstein_patient_2008]. Additionally, there is a growing prominence of client engagement in initiatives to address persistent and seemingly intractable problems in professional organizations and systems [@mayo_organizational_2021]; [@boivin_growing_2018; @heaphy_dancing_2017; @fayard_how_2017]. Scholars are increasingly recognizing that profession-client relations merit more attention, and recent research has investigated how professionals engage clients to maintain or expand their jurisdictional control [e.g., @chan_role_2021, in press; @mukherjee_feeling_2022, in-press; @huising_hive_2015]. But a focus on clients themselves as jurisdictional contestants remains elusive. We therefore theorize the processes leading clients to participate in jurisdictional contestation, and the specific ways in which they do so.

### Blurred boundaries of the client concept

Before going further, we need to clarify what we mean by ‘client’ and acknowledge the blurred boundaries of this concept. In many work domains, it is often not clear who is, and who is not, a client. Some recipients of professional work have not demanded or consented to it, as for instance when psychiatrists hospitalize and treat nonconsenting patients. ‘Clients’ do not pay professionals directly for their work when there is a third-party payer involved, such as the government or an insurance company [@shapiro_social_1987]. Also, professions use various terms to identify their clients (clients, consumers, patients, service users, etc.) and sometimes use different terms depending on the work domain (e.g., psychologists may say ‘patients’ in healthcare organizations and ‘clients’ in private practice). Being or not being a client is sometimes a political struggle, as with ‘queers’, ‘survivors,’ ‘fat’, and ‘mad’ folks who seek to de-medicalize their condition and refuse to be considered ‘patients’ [@epstein_patient_2008]. Moreover, the balance of power between professionals and clients varies greatly across work domains and contexts, as [@freidson_theory_1989, p429] explains:

> If clients are relatively few in number, sophisticated, well-organized and politically or economically powerful, the capacity of members of a profession to select the work they do and determine how they do it is markedly limited: their clients will call many of the shots. On the other hand, if clients are many, unorganized, heterogeneous and individually without significant resources of individual power, professionals are in a better position to call most of the shots.

The clients we theorize about are of the second type, which is typical in health-related work domains [@mayo_organizational_2021]. It is also typical of other professional domains such as education [e.g., @neuman_structured_2017], religion [e.g., @gutierrez_faithful_2010] and law and order [@cullors_anger_2018]. This type of client can be difficult to distinguish from members of the public, especially when the latter receive services unpredictably or sporadically; third-party payment and government mandates are involved; and/or the recipient of professional work do not explicitly consent to it [@freidson_theory_1989; @shapiro_social_1987].

By acknowledging that a set of criteria to reliably distinguish between clients and non- clients appears elusive, we embrace the blurred boundaries of the client concept. Accordingly, we consider as a client any person on the receiving end of professional work and over whom professional prescriptions apply [cf. @freidson_professional_1986, @hughes_men_1958]. This definition emphasizes the interdependence of professions and clients insomuch as they need each other to exist.

### Client participation in jurisdictional contestation

A profession’s clientele is heterogeneous [@chan_role_2021] and composed of segments with different social locations and embodied experiences [@robnett_emotional_2004]. Each person has a singular history, nourishes specific aspirations and commitments [@creed_place_2022; @voronov_people_2020], and experiences unique needs, even if their needs are shaped by the social groups to which they are attached [@barbalet_social_1996]. The trust of individual clients in the expert knowledge of a profession is shaped by a felt alignment between their needs and how a profession interprets and responds to them [@fayard_how_2017; @huising_hive_2015]. Therefore, when a social movement frames a profession’s expert knowledge as technically irrelevant, dangerous, and/or morally corrupt, it risks undermining clients’ trust in its expert knowledge and disrupting the profession’s jurisdictional control [@eyal_crisis_2019; @gurri_revolt_2018].

The disruptive framing efforts of a social movement typically rely on the experiential knowledge collectively held by its adherents, which forms a distinct epistemic basis on which to legitimize an evaluation of the profession’s work as flawed; and to promote a preferable alternative, peer-driven institutional project [cf. @diamond_what_2013; @taylor_v_emotions_2000]. [@borkman_experiential_1976, p446], a pioneering sociologist of mutual aid, has defined _experiential knowledge_ as a “concrete, specific, and commonsensical (…) wisdom and know-how gained from personal participation in a phenomenon.” Her research indicates that a person’s experiential knowledge is validated by the “conviction that the insights learned from direct participation in a situation are truth, because the individual has faith in the validity and authority of the knowledge obtained by being part of a phenomenon” (p. 447). Research on mutual aid groups has shown that the construction of experiential knowledge is a collective, interpretive process involving peers giving meaning to their lived experiences through reciprocal sharing of first-person accounts in dedicated spaces [@jouet_construction_2010; @epstein_patient_2008].

The social movements we have in mind are of this kind. They emerge from marginalized identity-based communities seeking to emancipate themselves from internalized conceptions of being flawed and dependencies on others, including professionals, that are taken for granted. They validate the experiential knowledge of individual clients and help clients to reinterpret their situation as being caused by societal prejudice and systemic injustice in which a profession’s expert knowledge is deeply implicated, according to movement adherents [e.g., @gould_moving_2009; @schrock_creating_2004; @britt_shame_2000]. Because this consciousness raising and mobilization is commonly described as a highly emotional process, we next consider how emotions lead an individual client to participate in jurisdictional contestation.

### Role of emotions in client participation

Studies of professions have begun to consider how social emotions shape inter-profession competition [e.g., @goodrick_preserving_2020; @chreim_constructing_2020]. But so far, most research on client-profession relations has not used an emotions lens [e.g., @evans_how_2021; @huising_professional_2021; @chan_role_2021; but see @mukherjee_feeling_2022, in-press]. A recent effort to theorize emotions in jurisdictional contestation by clients was made in @wang_grace_2021 study of Chinese patients’ changing attitudes towards physicians. The study finds that a market-oriented reform of government financing for physicians’ work incentivized physicians to boost their income by overprescribing, which undermined patients’ trust in the profession’s expert knowledge. As a result, patients who used to proudly call physicians “angels in white” began shaming them as “wolves in white.” This shift, driven by widespread anger, led to a wave of aggressions by patients against physicians.

These recent findings echo early work by Everett Hughes, a canonical figure for scholars of professions [@chapoulie_everett_1996; @abbott_time_1997], who wrote that there is an “aggressive suspicion which most laymen feel towards professionals, and fanatical anger which burns chronically in some people and which at times becomes popular reaction” [@hughes_men_1958, p27]. With these colorful remarks, Hughes implied that a profession’s ability to control a work domain depends on the extent to which clients trust the profession’s expert knowledge to appropriately inform the interpretation of, and prescribed response to, their felt needs. Hughes’ remarks also implied that client participation in jurisdictional contestation is an intensely emotional social process.

Emotions shaping client participation in jurisdictional contestation have been most abundantly documented in studies of social movements challenging professions [e.g., @gould_moving_2009; @britt_shame_2000; @bayer_homosexuality_1987]. Anger, for instance, led to the mobilization of activists who challenged the medical and pharmaceutical professions in the early years of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, leading patients to push back against health professionals by setting up their own care and treatment organizations [@maguire_discourse_2002]. In this episode, and many others henceforth cited, a highly emotional framing contest arose between a challenger social movement and an incumbent profession to gain the trust of clients in their respective forms of knowledge and to lead them to support their disruptive and defensive institutional projects, respectively.

We build upon emerging literature on clients in the relational perspective on professions [@chan_role_2021; @huising_professional_2021; @eyal_crisis_2019] by theorizing how individual clients come to participate in jurisdictional contestation. We do so by mapping distinct configurations of social emotions, experienced by clients exposed to a movement/profession framing contest, to five modes of participation enacted by clients in episodes of jurisdictional contestation. We call these modes _escape_, _opposition_, _accommodation_, _acquiescence_, and _stewardship_.
